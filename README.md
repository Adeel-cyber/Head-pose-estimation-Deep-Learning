# Head pose estimation using Deep Learning

## Introduction
The task of head pose estimation is a task with a wide number of applications, to simple applications like student distraction detection over eLearning solutions to much more crucial ones like driver sleepiness detection. The task requires a user to predict the tilt and pan of a head using a front facing single image. The tilt is the vertical angle of a person's head, and the pan is the horizontal angle. Both tilt and pan are said to be zero when a person is looking straight towards the camera with their chin up. Though in a complete system additional information is required, for the purposes of these assignments only an image will be used to predict the aforementioned attributes to classify the human head pose.
